## Experience

### Télécom SudParis — Associate Professor (Applied ML/AI)  
*07/2021 – Present · Paris, France*

- Co-delivered with an HR partner a recruiter assistant and a job recommender; integrated into client CRM; demonstrated measurable lifts over baselines and reduced time-to-shortlist.
- Built a resume augmenter that infers and verifies technical skills from public activity signals; improved discovery of latent skills and downstream match precision.
- Fine-tuned and evaluated language models (Hugging Face Transformers) for temporal QA and knowledge cleaning; optimized prompts/training for latency and cost.
- Led a team of 3 PhD students; managed two industry partnerships end-to-end (scoping → delivery); collaborated closely with engineering and product stakeholders.
- Head of AI programs at Télécom SudParis and Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

---

### Max Planck Institute for Informatics — Postdoctoral Researcher  
*10/2020 – 08/2021 · Saarbrücken, Germany*

- Scaled information extraction over large web crawls; built QA over extracted triples.
- Fine-tuned LLMs for knowledge discovery and validation; used multimodal signals for verification.

---

### Télécom Paris — Doctoral Candidate (Ph.D. in Computer Science)  
*09/2017 – 09/2020 · France*

- Published in top venues focusing on information extraction, NLP, and graph-based methods.
- Created **Pyformlang**, a production-quality Python library for formal language manipulation that became the most used in its category.

---

### Haufe-Umantis — Junior Data Scientist  
*01/2017 – 07/2017 · St. Gallen, Switzerland*

- Prototyped people-analytics features and recommenders within the HR suite.
- Presented solutions to enterprise clients (including Daimler).

---

## Selected Projects

- **Explainable Job Recommendation (GNN)**  
  Built a heterogeneous graph from résumés, job posts, and behavioral signals; trained a GNN-based ranker with path-based explanations; outperformed strong baselines; deployed as a POC with an HR partner.

- **Knowledge Generation & Cleaning with LLMs**  
  Used LLMs to generate and clean knowledge, improving precision vs. manual curation and reducing operational overhead.

- **Financial Time-Series with Exogenous Signals**  
  Integrated news and sentiment features into forecasting models; improved explainability and robustness on large datasets.

---

## Open Source

- **Pyformlang** — Lead maintainer  
  ~53 GitHub stars; ~81k downloads (PyPI / pypistats).  
  Widely used for formal language manipulation in Python; adopted in coursework and research.
