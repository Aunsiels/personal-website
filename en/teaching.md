I co-direct the **DataAI Master’s program** at Institut Polytechnique de Paris  
and direct the **MAIA apprenticeship Master** at Télécom SudParis, where I help design 
curricula that combine solid theoretical foundations with practical AI training.

I teach across programming, data science, machine learning, and modern AI systems.

## Teaching philosophy

My teaching is guided by a few principles:

- **Balance between theory and practice.** Students should understand what they do, and be effective when joining industry.  
- **Active learning.** I use pedagogical methods that encourage students to engage directly with concepts, which is even more important in the era of LLM assistants.  
- **Adaptability.** I teach diverse audiences (engineers, master’s students, managers), and I adapt content and examples to match their needs and backgrounds.

I aim to help students develop both strong technical foundations and responsible professional practices.
