This is a short introduction to my blog.

I plan to use this space to write about:

- ideas that do not fit into a research paper,
- reflections on teaching and pedagogy,
- small technical notes on AI, LLMs, and graph learning,
- and occasionally, personal projects or experiments.

If you are interested in a specific topic, feel free to reach out.
